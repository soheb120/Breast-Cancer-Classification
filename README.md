## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of tumors can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to create a model that can effectively classify tumors based on features derived from a dataset. 

The project includes:

- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
- Building a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training the model on the dataset.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Visualizing the results to understand the model's predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soheb120/Breast-Cancer-Classification.git
cd Breast-Cancer-Classification
```

### Download the Dataset

You can download the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or directly from this repository if available. Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and placed in the appropriate directory.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for model training. In this project, we perform the following steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: We load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: We check for and handle any missing values.
3. **Feature Selection**: We select relevant features that contribute to tumor classification.
4. **Normalization**: We normalize the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model training.

Here's a snippet of the code used for data preprocessing:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Handle missing values
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)

# Select features
features = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
labels = data['label']

# Normalize the data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

## Model Training

After preprocessing the data, we proceed to build and train the neural network model. The architecture consists of:

- An input layer that matches the number of features.
- Hidden layers with activation functions to capture complex patterns.
- An output layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

Hereâ€™s how we define and compile the model:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(features_scaled.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

We then train the model on the training data:

```python
model.fit(features_scaled, labels, epochs=50, batch_size=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, we evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset. We measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model classifies tumors.

Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet for evaluation:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Predict on test data
predictions = model.predict(test_features)

# Generate classification report
report = classification_report(test_labels, predictions)
print(report)
```

## Result Visualization

Visualizing the results helps us understand the model's performance better. We can plot the training history to see how accuracy and loss change over epochs. 

Hereâ€™s how we visualize the training history:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot training & validation accuracy values
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])
plt.title('Model accuracy')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.legend(['Train', 'Test'], loc='upper left')
plt.show()
```
